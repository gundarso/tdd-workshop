# Practical example

Create a small example, TDD way

- Calculator
  - from string
  - we're not testing the user interaction (let's put it in another class!) - "separation of concerns"
  - "3 + 4"
  - "3 x 4"
  - "3"
  - "4 / 2"
  - "4 / 0"
  - "2 + A"
  - "3 + 4 + 5"
  - "3 + 4 * 5"
  - "(3 + 4) * 5" (resolve parenthesis first)
  - "" (resolve inner parenthesis first)
- TicTacToe
  - Game
  - Player
  -   
- Bowling (too complex)
